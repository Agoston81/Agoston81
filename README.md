- 👋 Hi, I’m @Agoston81 from UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a social media App that the public can use to send messages to their friends and family members after death.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and one day I would like to learn C++ too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar projects too.
- 📫 You can reach me here if you have some idea how this App should work.
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr 😀
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Japanese culture.
